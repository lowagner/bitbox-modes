run.c:
    tile translation
    hide sprites which are completely set inside another block with zero velocity.
        - compute a "hidden" property (make z=0 be hidden)
        - reset when going to map mode (always z=1 or higher)
        - compute when going to run mode?
    
    sprites:
        add velocity to objects

sprite property editing
    sprite:
