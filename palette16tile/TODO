run.c:
    tile translation
    hide sprites which are completely set inside another block with zero velocity.
        - compute a "hidden" property (set z=0 to hide) when transitioning to run mode
        - reset when going to map mode (always z=1 or higher)
    
    sprites:
        add velocity to objects

sprite pattern commands:
    wait
    look for player
    change speed
    set chase if player within some multiple of speed
    jump (literally, not in command)
    command goto, if within chase mode
    command goto, unconditional
    command goto, if in the air
    turn
    move forward (some number of paces)
    set edge behavior (turn, fall, jump)
    randomize command
    follow player input (can reverse it, or only in one direction, etc.)
    spawn other sprite (projectile)
    shake screen
    make noise

unlock pattern commands:
    wait
    set spawn location x, y (needs 10 bits for each x,y)
    spawn sprite
    spawn tile (this can also destroy a tile if you spawn an "air" tile)
    randomize command
    set spawn location to player location (2 bits for offset in each direction)
    set spawn location delta x, y
    shake screen
    make noise
